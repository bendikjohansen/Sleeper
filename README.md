# Sleeper

A very small app that shuts down apps on your Mac and puts it to sleep after some time has passed.

I used to fall asleep to songs when I was sleeping in a loft bed, and I would start this program to shut down quietly after an hour or so.

I must have made this over ten years ago using automator.
